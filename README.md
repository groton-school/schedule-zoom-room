# Schedule Zoom Room

Populate Zoom Room resource calendar from Blackbaud LMS schedule

## How this works

This generates an ICS calendar file to import into a Zoom Room calendar. Paste in the webcal URL of a faculty member's schedule from the LMS. Check off the blocks for which you would like to include from the faculty calendar and paste in the relevant Zoom meeting URLs for each block. Optionally, give the calendar a meaningful name (&ldquo;Smith, Room 123&rdquo;). Click <em>Go</em> to download the ICS calendar of Zoom meetings.</p>
